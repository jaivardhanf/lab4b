Files contained:


lab4b.c: source files for an embedded application that builds and runs (with no errors or warnings) on an embedded system.


Makefile has the following targets:


check.sh - smoke tests.

default - build your program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).

check - execute an automated smoke-test of your application to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors.

clean - delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile

dist - (runnable on a Linux desktop or server) create the deliverable tarball
